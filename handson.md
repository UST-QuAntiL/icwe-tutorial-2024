# Hands-On Session

TODO

The use case utilizes the following tools:

* [Pattern Atlas](https://github.com/PatternAtlas): TODO.
* [Process View Plugin](https://github.com/UST-QuAntiL/camunda-process-view-plugins): TODO.
* [OpenTOSCA Container](https://github.com/OpenTOSCA/container): TODO.
* [Quantum Workflow Modeler](https://github.com/PlanQK/workflow-modeler): A graphical BPMN modeler to define, transform, and deploy quantum workflows.
* [Quokka](https://github.com/UST-QuAntiL/Quokka): A microservice ecosystem enabling a service-based execution of quantum algorithms.
* [Winery](https://github.com/OpenTOSCA/winery): A web-based modeler for TOSCA-based deployment models, which can be attached to activities of quantum workflows to enable their automated deployment in the target environment.

## Setup

The code required for the hands-on session is available [here](https://github.com/UST-QuAntiL/QuantME-UseCases/tree/master/2024-icwe-tutorial).

In case you participate in the tutorial on-side and use one of the provided virtual machines, please only download the workflow model available [here](TODO).
Afterwards, move to [Part 1](#part-1-qaoa-for-maxcut) and use the provided IP to replace the placeholder $IP.

On Windows, you have to activate long paths for Git to enable cloning and pushing to this repository.
Thus, execute the following command:

```
git config --system core.longpaths true
```

Afterwards, clone the repository and navigate to the ``2024-icwe-tutorial`` folder:

```
git clone https://github.com/UST-QuAntiL/QuantME-UseCases.git
cd QuantME-UseCases/2024-icwe-tutorial
```
