# Tutorial Structure

The tutorial comprises two sessions, including both lectures and practical activities:

In the first session, the following topics are discussed:

- First, basic concepts and application areas of quantum computing are introduced.
- The second part of the session presents a concept and a corresponding toolchain to convert quantum algorithms into quantum web services using OpenAPI specifications.
- This toolchain is then used in a practical session to deploy a web service based on the Qiskit SDK.
- Finally, an approach for orchestrating hybrid quantum applications using workflows is presented, facilitating the integration of classical and quantum programs.

The second session is planned as follows:

- The concepts discussed in the first session are applied in a practical session, where attendees model and execute two quantum workflows.
- Finally, attendees are requested to participate in a survey to evaluate the presented concepts and can propose desired extensions to the toolchain.
