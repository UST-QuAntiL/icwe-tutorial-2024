# Tutorial Structure

The tutorial comprises two 90 min sessions, including both lectures and practical activities:

In the first session, the following topics are discussed:

- First, basic concepts and application areas of quantum computing are introduced.
- The second part of the session presents a concept and a corresponding toolchain to convert quantum algorithms into quantum web services using OpenAPI specifications.
- This toolchain is then used in a practical session to deploy a web service based on the Qiskit SDK
- Finally, an approach for orchestrating hybrid quantum applications using workflows is presented, facilitating the integration of classical and quantum programs.

The second session is planned as follows:

- TODO
